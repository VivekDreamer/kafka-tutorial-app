# KAFKA SETUP

Below is the guide to setup the kafka environment.


## Documentation


## STEP 1: GET KAFKA
Download the latest Kafka release and extract it:

$ tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.5.0.tgz

$ cd kafka_2.13-3.5.0

## STEP 2: START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.

Apache Kafka can be started using ZooKeeper or KRaft. To get started with either configuration follow one the sections below but not both.

Kafka with ZooKeeper
Run the following commands in order to start all services in the correct order:

### Start the ZooKeeper service
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Open another terminal session and run:

### Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.

### Kafka with KRaft
Generate a Cluster UUID

$ KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID="$(bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid)"

Format Log Directories

$ bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID -c config/kraft/server.properties

Start the Kafka Server

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties

Once the Kafka server has successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.

## STEP 3: CREATE A TOPIC TO STORE YOUR EVENTS

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that lets you read, write, store, and process events (also called records or messages in the documentation) across many machines.

Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements from IoT devices or medical equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in topics. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder.

So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic. Open another terminal session and run:

$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

## STEP 4: WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC

A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing (or reading) events. Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and fault-tolerant manner for as long as you needâ€”even forever.

Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic. By default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being written to the topic.

$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

This is my first event

This is my second event

You can stop the producer client with Ctrl-C at any time.

## STEP 5: READ THE EVENTS

Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the events you just created:

$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

This is my first event

This is my second event

You can stop the consumer client with Ctrl-C at any time.

Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer terminal (previous step) to write additional events, and see how the events immediately show up in your consumer terminal.

Because events are durably stored in Kafka, they can be read as many times and by as many consumers as you want. You can easily verify this by opening yet another terminal session and re-running the previous command again.
